# Change Log

## [v0.20170308.0](https://github.com/kevinoid/appveyor-swagger/tree/v0.20170308.0) (2017-03-08)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/kevinoid/appveyor-swagger/compare/v0.20170107.1...v0.20170308.0)

- **API Breaking**  `getEnvironments`, `getEnvironmentDeployments`, and
  `getProjectDeployments` responses now include fewer properties.  Introduce
  `*LookupModel` schemas for these abbreviated types (based on the name in the
  XML) and rework the existing schemas to use them where appropriate.
- Add `encryptValue` operation to encrypt a string value for use in
  `StoredValue` properties (e.g. environment variable values).
- Add more documentation for properties with non-obvious behavior.
